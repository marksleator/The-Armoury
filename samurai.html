    <p class="info">The samurai (also bushi) were a class of warriors which arose in the 10th century CE in medieval Japan and which lasted until the 17th century CE. The type has been romanticised since the 18th century CE as the epitome of chivalry and honour. Whilst there are many examples of samurai displaying great loyalty to their masters, the reality is that warfare in medieval Japan was as bloody and as uncompromising as it was in any other region. It is true that, from the 17th century CE, and no longer needed in a military capacity, samurai often became important moral teachers and advisors within the community.</p>
